## ODDS OF FINDING THE RIGHT DOOR
Door game tests the theory of selecting the right door when one of the wrong door got revieled.
The probability is 66.66% of winning when the decision is changed after finding one of the wrong doors.
Changing decision increases the chance of being right when sampled on large numbers only.
So playing huge number of games increases the probability of being victorious but the highest we can beat the game is 66.66 only it can never be higher than that.
