## ODDS OF FINDING THE RIGHT DOOR
Door game tests the theory of selecting the right door when one of the wrong door got revieled.
The probability is 66.66% of winning when the decision is changed after finding one of the wrong doors.
Changing decision increases the chance of being right when sampled on large numbers only.
So playing huge number of games increases the probability of being victorious but the highest we can beat the game is 66.66 only it can never be higher than that.

## WINNING A SCRATCH MONKEY GAME
Scratch monkey game has the probability of winning 44.44% for each monkey when both monkeys play by these rules,
	1) Both monkeys will copy what other monkey did on the previous time.
	2) Both monkeys will decieve the other monkey at random places on the game.
But one of the monkeys got more number of chances to cheat, that monkey always wins.
The number of time a monkey gets to cheat greatly affects the probability of winning the game.
when monkey 2 gets double the amount of chances to cheat on a game the results are,
Game 1:
	draw : 18685
	m1 : 40544
	m2 : 40771
	
Game 2:
	draw : 18463
	m1 : 40675
	m2 : 40862

The more the chances, the monkey gets to cheat, the higher the probability that monkey wins.
